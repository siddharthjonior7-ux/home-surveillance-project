 Home Surveillance System using Python and OpenCV

📌 Project Overview
This project is a *Home Surveillance System* developed using *Python* and *OpenCV*.  
It uses a camera to monitor the surroundings and detects *human faces in real-time* using a Haar Cascade classifier.  
The system can be used as a basic security solution for homes or offices.

---

🎯 Objectives
- To monitor live video feed using a camera
- To detect human faces in real-time
- To demonstrate the use of computer vision in security systems

---

 🛠 Technologies Used
- *Python*
- *OpenCV (cv2)*
- *Haar Cascade Classifier*
- *Jupyter Notebook*

---

📂 Project Files
- Home surveillance.ipynb – Main Python notebook containing the code  
- haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml – Pre-trained model for face detection  

---

 ⚙ How It Works
1. The camera captures live video.
2. Each video frame is converted to grayscale.
3. Haar Cascade classifier detects faces in the frame.
4. Rectangles are drawn around detected faces.
5. The video feed is displayed in real-time.
